# 🧮 Java Console Calculator

## 📘 Overview

This project is a console-based calculator application developed in Java. It provides users with an interactive, menu-driven interface to perform various mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power computation, square, and square root.

The calculator is designed with a modular architecture using individual methods for each operation. The implementation prioritizes clarity, error handling, and input validation, making it suitable as a foundational project for understanding Java programming and control flow structures.

## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Core Functionalities

- **Addition**: Adds multiple numbers provided by the user.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts a sequence of numbers from an initial value.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies a list of user-provided values.
- **Division**: Performs division after checking for zero-division errors.
- **Square**: Computes the square of a single number.
- **Square Root**: Calculates the square root of a non-negative number.
- **Power**: Raises a base to an exponent using `Math.pow`.

### 🛡️ Input Handling and Safety

- Global `Scanner` object to manage all user inputs efficiently.
- Validations to prevent division by zero.
- Restrictions on square root for negative numbers.
- Continuous loop for repeated operations until explicitly exited by the user.

## 🔁 Program Flow

The calculator operates in a continuous loop until the user selects the exit option. The flow is managed using a `while` loop paired with a `switch-case` structure to handle the chosen operation.

Each operation is encapsulated in a dedicated method, improving readability and maintenance.
